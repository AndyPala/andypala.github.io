				<img class="ui medium right floated image" u="image" src="./images/sydney/9.gif" />
				
				<h4>Location</h4>
				<p>The University of Sydney has several campuses and teaching facilities spread across greater Sydney, but most of our faculties and student support services are based on the Camperdown and Darlington campuses.</p>

				<p>In many ways this campus is like a small town, it even has its own postcode. Although it's just a 15-minute bus ride from central Sydney (or a 10-minute walk from Redfern train station), the campus is filled with its own services.</p>

				<p>There are shops, banks, a post office, doctors, chemists, bookshops, heaps of cafes and bars, and a security bus to get you around safely at night.</p>

				<p>The Camperdown and Darlington campuses also house our library, the largest academic library in the Southern Hemisphere, where you can access literally millions of print and online resources.</p>

				<h4>Entry Requirements</h4>
				<p>We believe that university should be an achievable goal for anyone with the talent and motivation to fulfil their potential. That's why we welcome promising students from all social and cultural backgrounds, and support you in a multitude of ways while you're here.</p>

				<p>Entry to most of our courses is assessed on the basis of your academic results. For Year 12 students this will be your Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) or equivalent. For non-year 12 students, this might be your ATAR or equivalent, tertiary or TAFE study or (for mature aged entry) a foundation course. Getting the 'right' ATAR is not the only way you can be accepted to study here, we offer other pathways as well.</p>

				<p>For your application to be successful it needs to meet two requirements</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You must possess at least one recognised academic qualification</li>
					<li>Your results in your qualification need to be sufficiently competitive in comparison to those of the other applicants.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>So having a qualification is your first essential selection criteria to meet for all of our undergraduate courses. However, for some of our courses, such as medicine, dentistry, music, veterinary science and the visual arts, we consider more than just your marks, you need to meet additional selection criteria.</p>

				<h4>Costs, Fees and Financial Support</h4>
				<p>Going to university is a big commitment in many ways, not least financially. These pages explain how much you will have to contribute to the cost of your education, as well as what your living costs are likely to be.</p>

				<p>However, you shouldn't let the cost of study deter you. If you do come to study at Sydney, there's plenty of support once you get here. We have bursaries and scholarships to help students in financial need and reward academic excellence. Our support includes bursaries specifically designed to help first-year students with the costs of coming to uni.</p>
				<p>The fees you pay at the University of Sydney can be divided into three main types:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Tuition fees.</li>
					<li>The Student Services and Amenities Fee.</li>
					<li>Incidental fees for equipment or protective clothing (a requirement of some courses), please contact the faculty.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Most University of Sydney undergraduates are Commonwealth-supported students, which means the federal government funds part of your tuition costs and you pay a 'top up' amount through a student contribution.</p>

				<div class="sliderino">
					<div id="slider2_container_3" style="position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 600px; height: 300px; margin-bottom:5px">
						<!-- Slides Container -->
						<div u="slides" style="cursor: move; position: absolute; overflow: hidden; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 600px; height: 300px;">
							<div>
								<img u="image" src="./images/sydney/5.jpg" />

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>If you are an Australian citizen or hold a permanent humanitarian visa, you are eligible for HECS-HELP (the federal government's Higher Education Loan Program). This means you can choose to either pay your student contribution upfront with a 10 percent discount ('HECS-HELP discount'), or defer all or part of your contribution through the Australian Taxation Office ('HECS-HELP loan'). Essentially, you only start repaying this loan when you earn over a certain amount.</p>

				<p>To work out how much your units of study will cost for a Commonwealth-supported student you will need to know:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The unit of study name</li>
					<li>The unit of study code (or digit)</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>SCHOLARSHIPS FOR INTERNATIONAL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS</h4>
				<h5>International students at the University of Sydney</h5>
				<p>The scholarships listed below have funded the study of international students at the University of Sydney in the past. However, this is not a list of every scholarship that may be available throughout the world.</p>

				<p>Students are encouraged to look for funding from any source available to them. For example, you may be able to find further scholarship information from companies, universities in your home country, the Australian mission in your home country, by searching the internet, etc.</p>

				<p>For further information on international scholarships, you may also find it helpful to look at the information provided by the University's International Scholarships Development Office. Its website groups the scholarships by geographic region, so you can easily search for the ones that will be relevant to you, based on your country of origin.</p>
